JWs teach that faith alone is insufficient for salvation and emphasize works, such as door-to-door ministry.

**Biblical Evidence Against Works-Based Salvation:**

- **Ephesians 2:8-9**: “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith…not by works.”
- **Titus 3:5**: “He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy.”
- **Luke 23:43**: The thief on the cross was promised paradise without performing works.

Let’s look at Ephesians 2:8-9 in your New World Translation (NWT):  
‘By this undeserved kindness you have been saved through faith, and this is not of your own doing; rather, it is God’s
gift. No, it is not a result of works, so that no one may boast.’

1. This passage clearly says salvation is by faith, not works. What do you think it means when it says salvation is a
   gift from God?
2. If salvation is not earned by works, how do you reconcile this with the Watchtower’s emphasis on door-to-door
   preaching and other activities for salvation?

### Discuss Titus 3:5

Now let’s read Titus 3:5: ‘He saved us, not because of any righteous works we had done, but because of his own mercy. He
saved us through the
washing that brought us to life and through making us new by holy spirit.’

1. This verse reinforces that salvation is based on God’s mercy, not our works.
2. If good works can’t save us, how do you interpret the role of works in a Christian’s life?

### The Thief on the Cross (Luke 23:39-43)

Jehovah’s Witnesses might argue that works are necessary for salvation, but the thief on the cross challenges this
belief.

In Luke 23:39-43, Jesus tells the repentant thief on the cross, ‘Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in
Paradise.’

1. The thief had no opportunity to perform works like preaching or ministry. Yet Jesus promised him salvation.
2. How do you reconcile this example with the belief that works are required for salvation?

### James 2:26 – Faith Without Works is Dead

Jehovah’s Witnesses often cite James 2:26 to argue that faith without works is dead.

I’ve heard it said that James 2:26 proves works are necessary for salvation. Let’s read it together:  
‘Indeed, just as the body without spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.’

1. This verse shows that true faith produces works, not that works save us.
2. For example, Abraham was justified by faith before his works (Romans 4:2-3). His works demonstrated his faith, but
   they weren’t the basis of his salvation.

What do you think James means here? Could he be saying that works are evidence of faith rather than the means of
salvation?

### Romans 4:1-5 – Abraham’s Faith

Let’s go to Romans 4:1-5 in your NWT: ‘What, then, will we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the
flesh? If Abraham was declared righteous as a result of works, he would have reason to boast, but not toward God. For
what does the scripture say? “Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” Now to the man
who works, his pay is not counted as an undeserved kindness but as something owed. On the other hand, to the man who
does not work but puts faith in the One who declares the ungodly one righteous, his faith is counted as righteousness.’

1. Abraham was counted as righteous because of his faith, not because of his works.
2. Does this mean that faith alone, without works, is sufficient for salvation?

### Works as a Response to Salvation

The Bible makes it clear that works are important, but they are the result of salvation, not the requirement for it.
Let’s read John 15:5:  
‘Whoever remains in union with me, and I in union with him, this one bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do
nothing.’

1. This verse shows that works (‘bearing fruit’) come from being united with Jesus.
2. Would you agree that works are evidence of salvation, not the means to achieve it?
