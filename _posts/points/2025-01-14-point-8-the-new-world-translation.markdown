The NWT contains unique translations that align with JW theology but are inconsistent with standard biblical
scholarship.

**Examples to Challenge:**

- **John 1:1**: As noted above, Greek grammar does not support “a god.”
- **Colossians 1:16**: The insertion of “other” has no basis in the Greek text.
- **Hebrews 1:6**: Most translations say, “Let all God’s angels worship him [Jesus],” but the NWT changes this to “do
  obeisance.”

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe the NWT reflects a more accurate interpretation of Scripture, but there are several areas
where it differs from other translations. These differences often correspond to theological beliefs.

#### John 1:1 – "The Word Was a God"

One of the most well-known differences is in John 1:1.

Let’s look at John 1:1. In most translations, it reads: ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God’ (NIV, ESV, KJV).  
However, the NWT translates this as: ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.’

1. The term ‘a god’ introduces a distinction between God the Father and Jesus. But why does the NWT use the indefinite
   article ‘a’ when other translations consistently translate it as ‘God’?
2. Is this translation choice influenced by the belief that Jesus is not fully divine, as opposed to the orthodox
   Christian belief that Jesus is fully God, as expressed in other translations?

#### Colossians 1:16-17 – "All Other Things" vs. "All Things"

Another passage often cited is Colossians 1:16-17.

In Colossians 1:16-17, most translations say: ‘For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and
invisible... and in him all things hold
together’ (NIV, ESV). However, the NWT says: ‘By means of him all other things were created, in the heavens and on the
earth... all other things have been created
through him and for him.’

1. Why does the NWT insert the word ‘other’ into this verse?
2. Is it because the translation is trying to emphasize that Jesus is a created being, rather than affirming that Jesus,
   as God, is the Creator of everything without exception?

#### Hebrews 1:8 – "God is Your Throne"

Hebrews 1:8 is another key passage regarding the deity of Christ.

In Hebrews 1:8, most translations say: ‘But of the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, is forever and ever...’’ (NIV, ESV,
KJV).  
However, the NWT translates it: ‘But with reference to the Son: “God is your throne forever and ever...”’

1. Why does the NWT change the wording here?
2. Does this change in translation reflect a theological view that Jesus is not being called ‘God’ in the same way as
   the Father?

### Discuss the Translation Committees and Qualifications

Another point of discussion involves the translators of the NWT.

While I appreciate the effort to produce a translation that reflects Jehovah’s Witness beliefs, it's important to note
that the identities and qualifications of the translators of the NWT have been kept secret for many years. The Watch
Tower Society only revealed that the translation work was carried out by a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but there has
been no indication that any of the translators had formal credentials in biblical languages such as Hebrew or Greek.

1. Does this lack of transparency raise concerns about the objectivity and expertise in rendering the Bible’s texts?
2. In contrast, many other translations are done by committees of scholars from various Christian traditions who have
   advanced degrees in theology, biblical languages, and historical context. Does this influence the reliability of the
   translation?

### Theological Influence on Translation Choices

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe their translation reflects the "true" understanding of Scripture, but many critics argue
that some translation choices are influenced by their doctrines. For example, their translation of passages like John 1:
1 and Colossians 1:16-17 reflects their belief that Jesus is not fully divine.

It’s worth considering whether some of the NWT’s translation choices were influenced by doctrinal positions. For
instance, in passages like John 1:1, the translation of ‘the Word was a god’ seems to reflect the Jehovah’s Witness
teaching that Jesus is a created being, rather than God in the same way the Father is.

1. Does the fact that the NWT sometimes reflects specific theological views indicate that the translation may not be as
   neutral as it claims to be?
2. Should the translation of Scripture be free from theological bias to ensure the message is faithfully conveyed?

### Compare the NWT to Other Translations

You might want to provide examples of how other translations render certain key passages differently and why these
differences matter in understanding the nature of God and Jesus.

Let’s compare how some key passages are translated in the NWT versus other major translations.

- John 1:1: ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God’ (ESV, KJV). The NWT says,
  ‘the Word was a god.’
- Colossians 1:16-17: ‘By him all things were created’ (ESV) versus the NWT’s ‘By means of him all other things were
  created.’
- Hebrews 1:8: ‘Your throne, O God, is forever and ever’ (NIV) versus the NWT’s ‘God is your throne forever and ever.’

These differences significantly affect the understanding of the nature of Christ and His divinity. Does the consistent
translation of Jesus as ‘God’ in most translations provide a clearer and more accurate understanding of His true
identity?
