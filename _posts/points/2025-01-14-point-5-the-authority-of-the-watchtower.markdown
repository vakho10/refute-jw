JWs believe the Watchtower Society is God’s sole channel of communication.

**Challenged Their Exclusivity:**

- Deuteronomy 18:22: “If what a prophet proclaims…does not take place, that is a message the Lord has not spoken.”
  Highlight the Watchtower's failed prophecies (e.g., predictions for 1914, 1925, and 1975 about the world's end).
- Acts 17:11: The Bereans were commended for testing teachings against Scripture, not for blindly trusting an
  organization.

### Timothy 3:16-17 – Scripture as Sufficient

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that God speaks through the Watchtower Society, but this verse highlights the sufficiency of
Scripture.

Let’s read 2 Timothy 3:16-17 in your New World Translation: ‘All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for
teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be
fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.’

1. This passage says Scripture equips believers completely for every good work. If Scripture is sufficient, why is the
   Watchtower necessary to interpret it?
2. Could reliance on the Watchtower imply that the Bible isn’t fully understandable on its own?

### Acts 17:11 – The Bereans’ Example

Let’s read Acts 17:11: ‘Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they accepted the word with the
greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.’

1. The Bereans are commended for testing Paul’s teachings against Scripture. If even Paul’s teachings were verified
   independently, shouldn’t we apply the same standard to any modern teaching, including the Watchtower’s?
2. Why would God require an organization if individuals can examine Scripture themselves with the help of the Holy
   Spirit?

### John 14:26 – The Holy Spirit as Teacher

In John 14:26, Jesus says: ‘But the helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach
you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.’

1. This verse shows that the Holy Spirit teaches and guides believers. Doesn’t this suggest that believers can rely on
   the Holy Spirit rather than an organization?
2. Could the emphasis on the Watchtower’s role undermine the personal guidance Jesus promised through the Holy Spirit?

### Isaiah 43:10 – Witnesses for God

Jehovah’s Witnesses often cite this verse to support their identity as God's chosen people.

Let’s read Isaiah 43:10: ‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah, ‘Yes, my servant whom I have chosen.’

1. This verse was addressed to Israel as God’s chosen people. In the New Testament, Jesus commissions all believers to
   be His witnesses (Acts 1:8).
2. If all Christians are called to be witnesses, does this mean only one organization can fulfill this role?

### Matthew 24:45-47 – The Faithful and Discreet Slave

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe this passage refers to the Governing Body of the Watchtower Society.

Let’s read Matthew 24:45-47: ‘Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his
domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so!
Truly I say to you, he will appoint him over all his belongings.’

1. This parable speaks of a faithful slave, but it doesn’t specify the Watchtower or a specific organization. Could this
   apply to all faithful Christians who share God’s Word?
2. How do we know for certain this passage refers exclusively to the Governing Body?

### Deuteronomy 18:20-22 – Testing a True Prophet

The Watchtower has made several predictions about the end times that have not come to pass.

Deuteronomy 18:20-22 says: ‘However, the prophet who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded him
to speak or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die. And in case you should say in your heart: “How
will we know that Jehovah has not spoken the word?” When the prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah and the word is not
fulfilled or does not come true, then Jehovah did not speak that word.’

1. The Bible provides a clear test for identifying false prophets. If an organization makes predictions that fail,
   should it still be considered a reliable channel of God’s communication?
2. For example, the Watchtower predicted the end of the world in 1914, 1925, and 1975. How do you reconcile these failed
   prophecies with Deuteronomy 18?

### Galatians 1:8 – Avoiding Another Gospel

Let’s read Galatians 1:8: ‘However, even if we or an angel out of heaven should declare to you as good news something
beyond what we declared to you as good news, let him be accursed.’

1. Paul warns against accepting any gospel that deviates from the one originally given. Does the Watchtower’s emphasis
   on organizational authority and exclusive interpretation align with the simple gospel of salvation through faith in
   Jesus?
2. Could this be a reason to test all teachings, including those of the Watchtower, against Scripture?
