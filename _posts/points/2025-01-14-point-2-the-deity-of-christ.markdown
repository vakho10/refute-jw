Jehovah's Witnesses believe Jesus is a created being (Michael the Archangel).

**Jesus as Eternal and Creator:**

- **Colossians 1:16**: “For by him all things were created…” (JWs insert "other" in the NWT, implying Jesus is a created
  being, but the Greek text does not include "other").
- **Isaiah 9:6**: Jesus is called “Mighty God, Everlasting Father.”
- **John 8:58**: Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am,” invoking the divine name “I AM” (Exodus 3:14). JWs claim this
  means “I have been,” but the Greek phrase *ego eimi* directly refers to God’s eternal nature.

Jehovah’s Witnesses interpret Colossians 1:15-17 to claim Jesus is a created being. Their NWT adds the word "other" to
imply Jesus created “all other things.”

Let’s look at Colossians 1:15-17 in NWT. It says: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
because by means of him all [other] things were created in the heavens and on the earth.'

1. I notice the word 'other' is in brackets. That suggests it isn’t in the original Greek text, correct?
2. If Jesus created 'all things' (as most translations say), wouldn’t that exclude Him from being part of creation?

Also, the term 'firstborn' in verse 15 often refers to preeminence or authority, not literal birth. For example, Psalm
89:27 says of David, 'I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.' Does that mean David was
literally born first among kings, or does it signify his rank and authority?

### Look at John 8:58

Jehovah's Witnesses interpret Jesus' statement "I am" differently, avoiding its implication of divinity.

In John 8:58, Jesus says, 'Before Abraham came into existence, I am.' The NWT reads: 'I have been.' But the
original Greek uses the phrase *ego eimi*, which means 'I am.'

1. Doesn’t 'I am' connect directly to God’s statement in Exodus 3:14, where Jehovah says, 'I am who I am'?
2. Why would the Jews try to stone Jesus (John 8:59) unless they understood Him to be claiming divinity?

### Discuss Hebrews 1:6

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe Jesus is Michael the Archangel, not God.

Hebrews 1:6 says, 'Let all of God’s angels worship him.' In the NWT, the word 'worship' is replaced with 'do
obeisance.' But in the Greek, the word *proskyneō* is often used for divine worship (e.g., Matthew 4:10, where Jesus
says to worship God alone).

1. If Jesus were merely an angel (even Michael), why would God command all the angels to worship Him?
2. Doesn’t this verse show that Jesus is greater than the angels and worthy of worship as God?

### Discuss Revelation 22:12-13

Jehovah’s Witnesses teach that Jehovah alone is the Alpha and the Omega.

In Revelation 22:12-13, Jesus says, 'Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to repay each one
according to his work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.'

1. Isn’t 'Alpha and Omega' a title for Jehovah, as seen in Revelation 1:8?
2. If Jesus applies this title to Himself, doesn’t that affirm His deity and eternal nature?

### Discuss Isaiah 9:6

Jehovah's Witnesses agree that Isaiah 9:6 is a prophecy about Jesus.

Isaiah 9:6 describes Jesus as 'Mighty God' and 'Eternal Father.'

1. How can Jesus be called 'Mighty God' if He is not divine?
2. If Jesus is a created being, how do you reconcile Him being 'Eternal Father,' a term that implies no beginning or
   end?

### Conclude with John 20:28

Jehovah’s Witnesses argue that Thomas’s declaration was figurative.

In John 20:28, Thomas says to Jesus, 'My Lord and my God!' Notice that Jesus does not rebuke or correct Thomas for
calling Him God.

1. If Jesus were not God, wouldn’t He correct Thomas, as Peter corrected Cornelius when Cornelius tried to worship him
   in Acts 10:25-26?
2. Doesn’t Jesus’ acceptance of Thomas’s declaration affirm His divinity?
