JWs teach Jesus was resurrected as a spirit being, not in His physical body.

**Biblical Evidence for a Physical Resurrection:**

- **Luke 24:39**: Jesus says, “Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have
  flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
- **John 20:27**: Jesus invites Thomas to touch His wounds, proving His physical body.
- **Acts 2:31**: Peter says, “God did not abandon him to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.”

1 Corinthians 15:17 says: ‘And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins.’

This verse emphasizes how vital the resurrection is to our faith. So understanding the nature of Jesus’ resurrection is
crucial. Let’s examine the evidence in Scripture to see what it says about whether Jesus was raised physically or
spiritually.

### Luke 24:36-43 – Jesus’ Physical Appearance

Jehovah’s Witnesses argue that Jesus was raised as a spirit and only appeared in physical form temporarily.

Let’s read Luke 24:36-43:  
‘But while they were still speaking of these things, he himself stood in their midst and said to them: “May you have
peace.” But they were terrified, and because they thought they were seeing a spirit, they drew back. So he said to them:
“Why are you troubled, and why have doubts come up in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; touch
me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you see that I have.” And as he said this, he showed them
his hands and his feet. But while they were still not believing it because of their joy and were amazed, he said to
them: “Do you have something there to eat?” So they handed him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it before
their eyes.’

1. Jesus explicitly says, ‘a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.’ Doesn’t this indicate that He was
   raised physically?
2. Why would Jesus eat food if He were a spirit being? Eating is unnecessary for spirits but is a natural action for
   someone with a physical body.

### John 20:24-29 – Thomas and the Wounds

This passage provides more evidence for a physical resurrection.

Let’s read John 20:24-29: ‘But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. So
the other disciples were telling him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “Unless I see in his hands the print
of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will never believe it.”
Well, eight days later his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were
locked, and he stood in their midst and said: “May you have peace.” Then he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and
see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop doubting but believe.” Thomas answered him: “My
Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him: “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Happy are those who have not seen and
yet believe.

1. Jesus invited Thomas to touch His wounds. If He were resurrected as a spirit, why would His body still bear the
   physical marks of crucifixion?
2. Doesn’t this suggest continuity between Jesus’ pre-death and post-resurrection body?

### Acts 2:24-32 – Peter’s Sermon on the Resurrection

Peter’s sermon at Pentecost connects Jesus’ resurrection with His physical body.

Let’s look at Acts 2:24-32: ‘God resurrected him by releasing him from the pangs of death, because it was not possible
for him to be held fast by
it. For David says about him: “I keep Jehovah constantly in front of me, for he is at my right hand, so that I may never
be shaken. ... You will not leave me in the Grave, nor will you allow your loyal one to see corruption.” ... God
resurrected this Jesus, and of this we are all witnesses.’

1. Peter says that Jesus’ body did not see corruption. Doesn’t this indicate that Jesus’ physical body was raised rather
   than replaced by a spiritual form?
2. If Jesus was raised as a spirit, what happened to His physical body?

### Romans 8:11 – Resurrection and Physical Bodies

Paul teaches that Jesus’ resurrection is the model for believers.

Romans 8:11 says: ‘If, now, the spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised up
Christ Jesus from the
dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in you.’

1. This verse says that believers’ mortal bodies will be made alive like Jesus’. If Jesus was resurrected as a spirit,
   how does this align with the promise of bodily resurrection for believers?
2. Does this support the idea that Jesus’ resurrection was physical, setting a precedent for ours?

### Clarify Misinterpretations

Jehovah’s Witnesses might cite verses suggesting Jesus was a spirit.

I understand that verses like 1 Corinthians 15:45 say Jesus was made a ‘life-giving spirit.’ But this doesn’t mean He
ceased to have a physical body. Jesus’ resurrection body was glorified and no longer subject to decay or death, but it
was still physical.

For example:

- Jesus could walk through locked doors (John 20:19), yet He still had flesh and bones (Luke 24:39).
- Similarly, Philippians 3:21 says our resurrected bodies will be transformed to be like His. This shows glorified
  bodies retain physicality while being perfected.
