JWs refuse blood transfusions, citing Acts 15:29 (“abstain from blood”).

**Contextual Argument:**

- The prohibition on blood refers to dietary practices, not medical procedures.
- Jesus emphasized mercy and saving lives (Matthew 12:11, Luke 14:5), which can be applied to life-saving transfusions.

Jehovah’s Witnesses often cite Genesis 9:4, Leviticus 17:10-14, and Acts 15:28-29 to support their stance. Let’s look at
some of the verses often cited regarding blood.

#### Genesis 9:4

‘But flesh with its life - its blood - you must not eat.’

1. This command was given to Noah and refers to consuming blood as food. Do you think there’s a difference between
   eating blood and receiving it as a medical treatment?
2. If the purpose of the command is to respect life, could saving a life with a transfusion align with that principle?

#### Leviticus 17:10-14

‘If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who resides in your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly
set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from his people.’

1. This passage is part of the Mosaic Law. Since Christians are no longer under the Mosaic Law (Galatians 3:24-25), does
   this command apply today?
2. The context emphasizes not eating blood as part of sacrifices. How does this apply to medical procedures that weren’t
   even conceivable at the time?

#### Acts 15:28-29

‘For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: to
keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.’

1. The prohibition on blood in Acts refers to eating blood as part of idolatrous practices. Would you agree that the
   context is dietary rather than medical?
2. Could this verse be interpreted differently in light of advancements in medicine and the ability to save lives?

### Discuss the Sanctity of Life

Jehovah’s Witnesses emphasize respect for God’s commands, but the Bible also emphasizes the value of life.

Proverbs 24:11 says: ‘Rescue those who are being taken away to death, and hold back those staggering to the slaughter.’

1. This verse emphasizes taking action to save lives. If a blood transfusion can save someone’s life, doesn’t this align
   with God’s principle of valuing human life?
2. How do you balance the principle of respecting blood with the command to preserve life?

### Examine Jesus’ Example

Jesus often prioritized mercy over rigid adherence to rules.

Matthew 12:7 says: ‘If you had understood what this means, “I want mercy, and not sacrifice,” you would not have
condemned the guiltless.’

1. Jesus criticized those who prioritized ritual over compassion. Could the refusal of life-saving medical care conflict
   with Jesus’ teaching on mercy?
2. Would showing mercy in life-threatening situations reflect God’s love and compassion?

### Clarify the Nature of Blood Transfusions

Jehovah’s Witnesses may see blood transfusions as equivalent to eating blood, but there’s a key distinction.

Blood transfusions are not the same as eating blood, which involves digestion. A transfusion is more like an organ
transplant—it’s giving someone a part of the body to sustain life.

1. If organ transplants are acceptable, why wouldn’t the transfer of blood—another life-sustaining part of the body—also
   be acceptable?
2. Does viewing blood as food conflict with its actual medical use in transfusions?

### Appeal to Individual Conscience

The Bible speaks about following conscience in disputable matters.

Romans 14:5 says: ‘One person judges one day as above another; another judges one day alike. Let each one be fully
convinced in his own mind.’

1. Could decisions about blood transfusions be a matter of personal conscience rather than a blanket rule?
2. If a person’s conscience allows for a transfusion to save their life or the life of their child, could that still
   honor God’s principles?

### Medical Alternatives and Real-Life Scenarios

Jehovah’s Witnesses often advocate for bloodless medicine but may face situations where no alternative exists.

I understand Jehovah’s Witnesses encourage bloodless medical treatments, which is commendable. But in emergencies where
no alternatives are available, wouldn’t preserving life take precedence?

1. For example, if a child needed a blood transfusion to survive, how would you reconcile refusing treatment with Jesus’
   teaching to love and protect children (Matthew 18:10-14)?
2. Could accepting a transfusion be an act of faith in God’s provision through medical advancements?
