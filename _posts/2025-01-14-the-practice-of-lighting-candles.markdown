Jehovah’s Witnesses frequently state that Jesus did not explicitly instruct the practice of lighting of candles,
however, many Christian denominations view the practice as a meaningful tradition that aligns with biblical imagery of
light symbolizing Christ and God’s presence. It is not a biblical requirement but a tradition that enhances worship for
many believers.

Christianity allows for diversity in worship practices, provided they align with Scripture’s principles and focus on
glorifying God. Thus, the lighting of candles is a permissible and meaningful tradition for many, though not essential
for faith or salvation.

### **1. Historical Context of Candles in Worship**

- **Practical Use:** In the early Christian church, candles were used primarily for practical reasons, as they provided
  light in dark places during worship services, especially in catacombs or gatherings at night.
- **Symbolic Meaning:** Over time, candles took on symbolic meanings, representing Christ as the "Light of the World" (
  John 8:12) and the illumination of faith dispelling the darkness of sin.

### **2. Theological Basis**

- **Biblical References to Light:**
    - While Jesus did not directly instruct the use of candles, the Bible frequently uses light as a metaphor for God,
      Christ, and spiritual truth:
        - "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path" (Psalm 119:105).
        - "Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven"
          (Matthew 5:16).
    - The use of candles in worship settings can be seen as an extension of these biblical themes, symbolizing the
      presence of God, spiritual enlightenment, and the call to reflect Christ's light.

- **Early Christian Practices:**
    - The use of candles became part of Christian liturgical tradition, especially in the Eastern Orthodox, Roman
      Catholic, and some Protestant traditions. These practices are rooted in tradition rather than explicit biblical
      instruction.

### **3. The Principle of Christian Freedom**

- **No Explicit Command or Prohibition:**
    - The Bible does not explicitly command or forbid the use of candles in worship. This leaves room for Christian
      freedom, guided by the principle of edification and glorification of God (1 Corinthians 10:23–31).
    - Practices such as lighting candles are often matters of tradition and personal conviction, not essential doctrines
      of faith.

- **Unity in Non-Essentials:**
    - Christians are encouraged to respect differing practices and focus on unity in essential beliefs, as emphasized by
      Paul in Romans 14:5–6: "One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike.
      Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind."
