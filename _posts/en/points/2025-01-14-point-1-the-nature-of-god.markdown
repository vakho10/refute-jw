Jehovah's Witnesses reject the Trinity, teaching that Jehovah is the only God, and Jesus is His created son, not God
Himself.

**Biblical Evidence for the Trinity:**

- **John 1:1** (NIV): “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
- JWs translate this as “the Word was a god” in the New World Translation (NWT). Point out the inconsistency in
  their translation since Greek grammar supports “God,” not “a god.”
- **John 20:28**: Thomas says to Jesus, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus does not correct Thomas, affirming His deity.
- **Matthew 28:19**: Jesus commands baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, implying equality among
  the three.

### Discussing John 1:1

In John 1:1, NWT (New World Translation) Bible says, ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was a god.’ Let’s unpack this verse together.

1. Why does it say, ‘the Word was a god,’ instead of ‘the Word was God’?
2. If the Word (Jesus) is ‘a god,’ wouldn’t that suggest polytheism, which the Bible strongly opposes? (Isaiah 45:5
   says, ‘I am Jehovah, and there is no one else; there is no God except me.’)

Also, consider the original Greek text of John 1:1. The phrase ‘the Word was God’ (θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος) doesn’t include the
indefinite article ‘a.’ How do you reconcile this with the translation in the NWT?”

### Discussing John 20:28

Let’s look at John 20:28, where Thomas, upon seeing the resurrected Jesus, says, ‘My Lord and my God!’. In NWT Bible, it
reads the same way.

1. If Jesus were not God, why would Thomas call Him ‘my God’?
2. Notice Jesus doesn’t correct Thomas. Doesn’t this imply that Jesus accepted the worship as God?

### Exploring Isaiah 9:6

In Isaiah 9:6, a prophecy about Jesus says, ‘For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us; and the
rulership will rest on his shoulder. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of
Peace.’

1. How do JWs interpret Jesus being called ‘Mighty God’?
2. If Jesus is a created being, why would Isaiah refer to Him as ‘Eternal Father’? Doesn’t this suggest His divine and
   eternal nature?

### Discussing Matthew 28:19

In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands His disciples to ‘Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.’

1. Why does Jesus place Himself and the Holy Spirit alongside the Father in this command?
2. If Jesus were merely a created being, would it be appropriate for Him to be named equally with Jehovah?

### Addressing “I and the Father are One” (John 10:30)

John 10:30 says, ‘I and the Father are one.’ How do you interpret this?

1. In the context, the Jews immediately picked up stones to kill Jesus, accusing Him of making Himself equal with God (
   John 10:33). Why would they react this way if Jesus wasn’t claiming divinity?
2. Doesn’t this verse point to unity in nature or essence rather than just purpose?
