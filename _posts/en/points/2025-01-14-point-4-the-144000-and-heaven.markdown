JWs teach that only 144,000 people will go to heaven, based on their interpretation of Revelation 7:4 and 14:1-3.

**Broader Context in Revelation:**

- **Revelation 7:9**: Immediately after mentioning the 144,000, it describes “a great multitude that no one could count”
  standing before the throne in heaven.
- Why do JWs interpret the 144,000 literally but the "great multitude" figuratively?

### Revelation 7:4 and 14:1-3

Jehovah’s Witnesses interpret these passages as referring to a literal group of 144,000 individuals who will go to
heaven.

Let’s read Revelation 7:4 and 14:1-3 in NWT: ‘And I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000, sealed out of
every tribe of the sons of Israel.’ ‘Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who
have his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.’

1. These verses mention the 144,000, but they also describe them as coming from the tribes of Israel. Do you interpret
   this as literal or symbolic?
2. If the tribes of Israel are symbolic, could the number 144,000 also be symbolic, representing completeness or
   perfection?

### Discuss the Great Crowd (Revelation 7:9)

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe the "great crowd" refers to those who will live forever on Earth.

Now let’s read Revelation 7:9: ‘After this I saw, and look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all
nations and tribes and peoples
and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in
their hands.’

1. The great crowd is standing before the throne of God and the Lamb. Where is God’s throne located according to
   Revelation 4:2? (Heaven.)
2. If the great crowd is in heaven, could it suggest that more than 144,000 will be in heaven?

### Address John 10:16 – "Other Sheep"

Jehovah’s Witnesses interpret the "other sheep" as those with an earthly hope.

In John 10:16, Jesus says: ‘And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in, and they will
listen to my voice, and
they will become one flock, one shepherd.’

1. This verse mentions ‘one flock’ under ‘one shepherd.’ If all believers are one flock, doesn’t that suggest unity
   rather than a division into heavenly and earthly groups?
2. Could the ‘other sheep’ refer to Gentiles who were not part of Israel but would still be included in God’s kingdom?

### Discuss Matthew 5:5 – The Meek Inheriting the Earth

Jehovah’s Witnesses use Matthew 5:5 to argue for eternal life on a restored Earth.

Matthew 5:5 says: ‘Happy are the meek, since they will inherit the earth.’

1. In Psalm 37:29, the Bible also says the righteous will inherit the earth. Do you think this means they will inherit
   the current Earth or the new heavens and new earth mentioned in Revelation 21:1?
2. Could this inheritance refer to the new creation where heaven and earth are united (Revelation 21:3-4)?

### Examine Philippians 3:20-21 – Citizenship in Heaven

Philippians 3:20-21 says: ‘But our citizenship exists in the heavens, and we are eagerly waiting for a savior from
there, the Lord Jesus Christ,
who will transform our humble body to be like his glorious body by his great power that enables him to subject all
things to himself.’

1. This verse states that our citizenship is in heaven. If this applies to all believers, why would only 144,000 be in
   heaven?
2. Does this suggest that all who follow Christ are destined for heavenly glory?

### Revelation 21:3-4 – The New Heaven and New Earth

Revelation 21:3-4 describes God dwelling with humanity:  
‘Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people. And God himself will
be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor
outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.’

1. This vision shows God dwelling with all His people. Could this suggest a future where heaven and earth are united,
   rather than separate destinies for different groups?
2. How does this fit with the idea that some are in heaven while others remain on Earth?
