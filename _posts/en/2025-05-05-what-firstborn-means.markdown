One of the most persistent misunderstandings promoted by groups such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses is the claim that Jesus
Christ, being called the "firstborn" in Scripture, must be a created being — the literal first of God’s creatures. This
teaching distorts both the **meaning of "firstborn" in the Bible** and the **identity of Christ** as confessed by the
Orthodox Church since the time of the Apostles.

As Orthodox Christians, we affirm what the Church has always taught: **Jesus Christ is uncreated, eternal, and
consubstantial with the Father** — **"Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten, not made"**, as the Nicene Creed
declares. Let’s explore what the term "firstborn" (Greek: *prototokos*) really means in the Bible and how it applies to
Jesus.

### **1. Firstborn Does Not Always Mean "First Created"**

The word "firstborn" in the Bible is often used to denote **rank, status, or preeminence**, not merely birth order. This
is clear in **Psalm 89:27**, where God says of **David**:

> *"I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth."*

But David was not Jesse’s firstborn — he was the youngest of eight sons (1 Samuel 16:10–11). So how can David be called
"firstborn"? The answer is that **"firstborn" here signifies exalted status**, not literal birth order.

Similarly, in **Exodus 4:22**, God says:

> *"Israel is my firstborn son."*

Was Israel the first nation? No. This language means that **Israel held a special, chosen position** among the nations.

### **2. Christ the Firstborn: Preeminent, Not Created**

In **Colossians 1:15**, the Apostle Paul writes:

> *"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation."*

Jehovah’s Witnesses seize on this verse to argue that Christ is part of creation. But the very next verses refute them:

> *"For in Him all things were created… all things were created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in
Him all things hold together."* (Col. 1:16–17)

How can Christ be a creature **if all things were created through Him**? How can He be part of creation **if He existed
before all things**? The answer is: **He can’t**. The term "firstborn" here clearly means **supreme over creation**, not
**part of it**.

The Orthodox understanding, rooted in the apostolic faith, holds that **Christ is eternally begotten of the Father**,
not made. He is the **uncreated Logos**, through whom all things came into being (John 1:3).

### **3. Firstborn from the Dead: The Resurrected Lord**

In **Colossians 1:18**, Paul calls Christ:

> *"The firstborn from the dead, so that in everything He might be preeminent."*

Here again, "firstborn" means **preeminence**. Christ is not the first person ever raised from the dead (Elijah raised
the widow’s son, for example), but He is the **first to rise in a glorified, eternal body**, never to die again. In
this, He becomes the **source and model of the resurrection** for all believers.

### **4. The Orthodox Witness Against Heresy**

The ancient heresy of Arianism, which claimed that the Son was created, was **soundly condemned** at the First
Ecumenical Council of Nicaea (AD 325). The Jehovah’s Witnesses are simply reviving this old error under a new name.

The Orthodox Church rejects such blasphemy. Christ is not a creature. He is the **eternal Son**, **the I AM**, worshiped
with the Father and the Holy Spirit. He is the "firstborn" not because He was created, but because **He reigns supreme
over all** — creation, death, and the Church.

### **Conclusion**

When the Bible calls Jesus the "firstborn," it is not saying He was created. It is saying He is **preeminent**, *
*exalted**, and **Lord over all**. Twisting this term to deny Christ’s divinity not only contradicts the plain reading
of Scripture, but also the faith handed down by the Church through the ages.

Let us cling to the **true Christ**, not a diminished imitation. Let us worship Him as the **eternal Word**, the **Alpha
and the Omega**, who was and is and is to come — the **uncreated Son of the living God**.

> *"To Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen."* (Ephesians
> 3:21)
