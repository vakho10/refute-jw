The Jehovah’s Witnesses cult traces its origins to the Bible Student movement in the late 19th century. Here’s their chronological history:

**1870s - Early Foundations**: The movement that would become Jehovah’s Witnesses began in the 1870s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under the leadership of **Charles Taze Russell**. He and a group of Bible Students began studying the Bible in a non-denominational setting, challenging traditional Christian doctrines.

In 1879, **Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence**, later renamed _The Watchtower_, was first published. This magazine became the central publication for the movement, spreading their interpretations of the Bible.

**1881 - Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society**: In 1881, Russell incorporated the **Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania**, which would become the legal and organizational entity behind the movement. The Society’s aim was to print and distribute literature to promote their understanding of Christianity.

**1914 - World War I and the End Times**: Russell predicted that 1914 would mark the end of the “Gentile Times” and the beginning of God’s Kingdom on Earth. Although the world did not end in 1914, the event was marked by the start of World War I, which the movement interpreted as a sign of the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.

Following Russell’s death in 1916, **Joseph Franklin Rutherford** became the leader and introduced many changes, including the emphasis on the name “Jehovah” as the proper name of God.

**1931 - The Name “Jehovah’s Witnesses”**: In 1931, Rutherford introduced the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses” to distinguish the group from other Bible Student organizations and emphasize their belief in God’s name, Jehovah. This marked the official beginning of the group’s name.

**1940s-1950s - Post-War Growth and Doctrinal Changes**: Following World War II, Jehovah’s Witnesses experienced rapid growth, aided by aggressive missionary work and a focus on distributing literature.

They also adopted the doctrine of neutrality in political matters, avoiding participation in wars, political affiliations, and voting in elections. They were persecuted in many countries for their stance.

**1960s-1980s - Expansion and Globalization**: The 1960s and 1970s saw an increase in global growth and organizational restructuring, with increased attention to missionary work. This period also saw a tightening of doctrinal standards, particularly with regard to disfellowshipping, the practice of excommunicating members for doctrinal or behavioral infractions.

\*The 1975 date was promoted by the leadership as a possible date for the end of the world, leading to expectations of Armageddon. When it did not occur, some followers became disillusioned, but the movement continued to grow.

**1990s - The “Generation” Doctrine and Internet Growth**: In the 1990s, the Watch Tower Society introduced the “generation” doctrine, which suggested that people alive in 1914 would see the fulfillment of God’s Kingdom. This interpretation later changed, and the doctrine was revised as the organization clarified its beliefs on the end of times.

The use of the internet and digital media allowed Jehovah’s Witnesses to expand their reach and communicate more effectively, despite their traditional emphasis on door-to-door ministry.

**2000s-Present - Continued Expansion and Legal Challenges**: Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to expand globally, with millions of adherents worldwide. They also face ongoing legal challenges, particularly regarding their teachings on blood transfusions, disfellowshipping, and child abuse allegations.

They have maintained their distinct practices, such as abstaining from military service, refusing to salute the flag, and avoiding participation in national holidays and birthdays. They also continue to emphasize preaching work, with a strong presence of public witnessing and publications, such as The Watchtower and Awake!, in multiple languages.

It is apparent, that throughout their history, Jehovah’s Witnesses have maintained a distinct interpretation of the Bible and the end times, focusing on God’s Kingdom and the rejection of secular society. Despite controversy and legal challenges, they have grown to be a global cult with millions of adherents worldwide.
